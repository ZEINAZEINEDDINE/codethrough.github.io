- An introduction to the data.table package and its uses.
</div>

## *Introduction*
<br>
Modern machine learning applications need to process a large amount of data to be able to generate good analysis. This is necessary in order  to create accurate models. And so, this Code Through is here to introduce a package that is much useful when working with large data and mainly tabular data in R. This package is the **data.table**. The data.table package is so flexible and intuitive and leads to faster development. It is so popular because of its speed of execution on large data. So, with data.table we can type less code and get much faster speed.. In general we can say that this package is:

***
> A package designed for working with heavy duty data wrangling.

 ***
> An alternative to R’s default data.frame to handle large tabular data.

## *Loading data.table*
<br>
Like all other packages, data.table should first be installed using install.packages('data.table').
```{r}
library('data.table')
```
***
## *Importing data*
<br>
<div class = "row">
  
<div class = "col-md-4">
<br><br>Within this Code Through, we will work on the **iris** data set that is built in R. This data set was chosen as it is multivariate data set. It consists of 50 samples from three Iris species. Four features were measured in cm from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals.
</div>
  
<div class = "col-md-4">
<br><br>And now we will import the data using the data.table; so the imported data will be stored directly as a data.table.
</div>

```{r}
library(DT)
datatable(iris)
```


## *Data Table Syntax*
<br>
<style>
div.red { background-color:#ec7063 ; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "red">
This image shows the syntax of data.tables which is DT[ i , j , by]; where i refers to rows, j refers to columns, and by refers to adding a group as if our calculations will be done within this group.
</div>

## *Some Special Features*

Number of Entries: 
<br>
A specific number of entries can be determined using the drop down menu. by default it is 10. But if we want to limit the number of entries to 4 for example per table, this can be done: 

```{r}
datatable(iris, 
          options = list(pageLength = 4))
```
Search Bar:
<br>
A search bar appears at the top of the table which is so helpful when there is a large array of data as this allows us to search and explore it.

Sorting columns: 
<br>
To the right of each column name are two arrows:this is to allow to sort by ascending or descending order.

Filtering Columns:
<br>
The data.table function also allows users to filter each column depending on the data type.

Table Editing:
<br>
We can do some table editing using the argument editable. Then we will be able to double click a cell to edit its value.

```{r}
DT::datatable(head(iris), editable = 'cell')
```

Customizing Column Names:
<br>
By default, datatable() shows the column names present in the table. But we can change column titles and this is done by providing a new character vector to completely replace the column names of the data, as below; we will name the columns as colA, colB etc..:

```{r}
# colnames(iris) is a character vector of length 5, and we replace it
datatable(head(iris), colnames = c('COLA', 'COLB', 'COLC', 'COLD', 'COLE'))

```

And if we only want to change the name of one column we can do the following:


```{r}
# want to change 3rd column name to new new name
datatable(head(iris), colnames = c('new new name' = 3))
```

Table Caption:

<br>
A caption can be added to the table and this can be done through using the caption argument as follows:

```{r}
datatable(
  head(iris),
  caption = 'Table Caption: Testing.'
)

```

Column Filters
<br>
In addition to the general global search filter appearing on the top-right of the table, We can add a filter argument in datatable() to be able to do more specific column filters. 

```{r}
datatable(iris, filter = 'top', options = list(
  pageLength = 5, autoWidth = TRUE
))

```

Selecting a given set of columns
<br>
When doing data analysis we need to select some specific columns to work with the data we need. For example if we want to select the columns titled only as Sepal Width and Petal Width, we do the following:

```{r}
library(data.table)
myVector <- c('Sepal.Width','Petal.Width')
myVector
irisDT <- data.table(iris)
irisDT[, ..myVector]

```

## *Grouping*
<br>

1-How can we get the mean Petal Length for each Species?

Grouping is used to solve this and it can be done using the by argument. We will use the by argument to get the mean petal length for each species of the 3 types of Iris flowers under study.

```{r}
# Mean Petal Length by Species

irisDT[, .(mean_Petal.Length=mean(Petal.Length)), by=Species]
```

So the Setosa have a mean petal length of 1.46, the Versicolor has a mean Petal length od 4.2 and the Virginica has a mean Petal length of 5.552.


2- How can we know the Total number of setosa flowers we have?

```{r}

 irisDT[Species=="setosa", .N, by =Species]

```
So we have a total number of 50 Setosa flowers.

3- How can we know the average sepal length and average petal length of a setosa flower?

```{r}
irisDT[Species == "setosa",
        .(mean(Sepal.Length), mean(Petal.Length)),
        by = .(Species)]
```
Since we did not provide column names for the expressions in j, they were automatically generated as V1 and V2.

## *Chaining*
<br>
Chaining is so useful when doing data manipulation. With chaining we can do multiple data.table operations without having to store intermediate results. so with chaining we will reach our output with less written codes.


1– How can we order IRIS data related to the setosa flower using the column Sepal Length in descending order?

```{r}
irisDT[Species == "setosa", .N, by = .(Sepal.Length)][order(-Sepal.Length)]
head(irisDT, 10)

```
We can tack expressions one after another, forming a chain of operations, i.e., DT[ ... ][ ... ][ ... ].

## *.SD and its uses*
<br>
The .SD object is a data.table that contains all the columns of the original data.table except the column specified in ‘by’ argument. Here is an example:

```{r}
irisDT[, .SD, by=Species]
# returns the irisDT table grouped by Species
```


Also, we can specify the columns that should be part of .SD using the .SDCols as follows:

```{r}
output <- irisDT[, lapply(.SD, mean), by=Species, .SDcols=c("Sepal.Length", "Petal.Length")]
output
```

The output now contains only the specified columns relative to species types..

Now let us try to use .SD along with .SDcols to get the mean() of sepal length and petal length columns grouped by species.

```{r}
irisDT[Species == "setosa",         ## Only on setosa flowers 
        lapply(.SD, mean),          ## compute the mean
        by = .(Petal.Width),        ## for every petal width
        .SDcols = c("Sepal.Length", "Petal.Length")] ## for just those specified in .SDcols
```



## *.N and .I uses*
<br>
.N gives the number of rows present.

So the following will give the number of rows for each unique value of Sepal.Width.

```{r}
irisDT[, .N, by=Sepal.Width]
# < returns the number of rows for each unique value of Sepal.Width>
```

To create row numbers of items, we use the .I which is short for ‘index’ (I guess).

Thus, to return the row numbers where Sepal.Width=4 we do the following:

```{r}
irisDT[, .I[Sepal.Width==4]]
```

## *Keys*
<br>
Setting one or more keys on a data.table enables it to perform binary search, which is fast when we are dealing with large data.
Thus, the filtering operations are so fast after setting the keys. But we should be aware that by setting a key, the `data.table` gets sorted by that key.

1- how can we directly order by our data according to Sepal Width?

```{r}
irisDT[ Species=="setosa",
        .(mean(Sepal.Length), mean(Petal.Length)),
        keyby = .(Sepal.Width)]
```

So we have got a table of ordered values showing the mean sepal length and mean petal length according to sepal width ordered values.

Setting a key:

```{r}
setkey(irisDT, Sepal.Width)
#irisDT is sorted by Sepal.Width column 

```

Once the key is set, merging data.tables is very easy now. Here is an example where we  have created dt1 and dt2 to be joined later on.

```{r}
dt1 <- irisDT[,.(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length, Petal.Length)]
dt2 <- irisDT[1:10, .(Sepal.Width, Petal.Width)]
```

```{r}
dt1[dt2]
# Joining the 2 data
```


## *Joining 2 or more datatables*
<br>
With the data.table package we can make use of the merge()function.

```{r}
dt1 <- irisDT[5:25,.(Sepal.Width, Petal.Width)]
dt2 <- irisDT[1:10, .(Sepal.Width, Petal.Length)]
dt3 <- irisDT[2:12, .(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length)]

# Inner Join
merge(dt1, dt2, by='Sepal.Width')
```
